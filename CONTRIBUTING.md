# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for contributing to the OpenTASS project! Before you make your pull request, make sure your commits follow these rules:

1. Always follow the project's [Code of Ethics](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This means no trolling!

2. Follow the styleguides. These are mostly just [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) rules, which can be checked with the `flake8` formatter. The repository includes a linting action to check each commit and PR. We won't be too strict on it though. Also:

   - The line character limit has been increased to 125.
   - `number_one_rule = "Please use snake_case!"`
   - `f"If possible, format {variables} and into string as an f-string like this."`
   - Use print() when printing useful output. Use logging.info() or the logging module for status, errors, debugging or other purposes.
   - And of course, follow the linting.

3. Ensure your code works, ensure it works _well_, and ensure it works _on all platforms_. Test it to make sure it doesn't break anything, and _test it well_.

4. Name and describe issue and pull requests well. Provide clear, concise descriptions, and include details on the problem addressed and how your changes resolve it. If reporting an issue, adhere to the templates, uploading all useful relevant information including screenshots if applicable.

5. Make sure the code is consistent with the rest and intuitive. The UI (if applicable) should be responsive, intuitive and seamless across platforms.

6. Be open to improvements, comments and feedback! We will be as well, and it makes it a lot more enjoyable for all of us!

Again, thanks so much for contributing to this little insignificant project :)

We appreciate your efforts in making it better for everyone. Happy programming!
