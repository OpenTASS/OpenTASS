# OpenTASS

OpenTASS is a Python library that provides an API in order to access The Alpha School System through free-software.

The OpenTASS project also is developing accompanying GUI and CLI interfaces, as this repository only contains only the code for the module/API. Other programs, like the OpenTASS GUI and CLI, can harness this library to get their data from TASS.
