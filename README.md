# OpenTASS

OpenTASS is a Python library that provides an API in order to access The Alpha School System through free-software.

The OpenTASS project also is developing accompanying GUI and CLI interfaces, as this repository only contains only the code for the module/API. Other programs, like the OpenTASS GUI and CLI, can harness this library to get their data from TASS.

While the aim of this repository is not to provide a direct user interface to use TASS, you can run any file such as `login.py` and `timetable.py` and it will accept arguments from the command line and will respond sanely. This is useful if you would like to get a hang of what kind of output this module provides to use in your application, and also useful for debug purposes.
