# OpenTASS

OpenTASS is a Python library that provides an API in order to access The Alpha School System through free-software.

The OpenTASS project also is developing accompanying GUI and CLI interfaces, as this repository only contains only the code for the module/API. Other programs, like the OpenTASS GUI and CLI, can harness this library to get their data from TASS.

While the aim of this repository is not to provide a direct user interface to use TASS, you can run any file such as `login.py` and `timetable.py` and it will accept arguments from the command line and will respond sanely. This is useful if you would like to get a hang of what kind of output this module provides to use in your application, and also useful for debug purposes.

For the other projects of the OpenTASS Project, please see the [Directory](https://github.com/OpenTASS).
